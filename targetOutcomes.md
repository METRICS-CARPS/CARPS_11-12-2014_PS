For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section of Study 1.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> We next tested our primary hypothesis that participants would be
more reluctant to reject the unattractive date when they
believed the situation to be real rather than hypothetical.
Only 10 of the 61 participants in the hypothetical condition
chose to exchange contact information with the
unattractive potential date (16%). In contrast, 26 of the
71 participants in the real condition chose to exchange
contact information (37%). A chi-square test of independence
indicated that participants were significantly less
likely to reject the unattractive potential date in the real
condition compared with the hypothetical condition,
Ï‡2(1, N = 132) = 6.77, p = .009.
